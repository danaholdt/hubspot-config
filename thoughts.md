*this might be best handled with a dockerfile...*

2. add npm package.json file to quickstart hs cli

3. possible github action for upload?

## uncategorized thoughts

- should we have a base.css file with our standardized setup?  

- we should investigate themes extensively. this could be the best way to bootstrap development and have a consistent process

- do we want scss file?  i find it to be more powerful, but we would not be able to use hubl syntax in it.
